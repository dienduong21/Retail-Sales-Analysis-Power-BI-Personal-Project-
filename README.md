## üìä Key Findings & Recommendations

### Inefficient Store Chain Distribution
- **Finding:** Fashion Direct generates higher revenue despite having fewer stores, while Lindseys has a wider network but lower efficiency and higher operational costs.
- **Recommendation:** Expand **Fashion Direct** in high-demand areas while optimizing and downsizing Lindseys‚Äô network to reduce costs.

### Seasonal Sales Fluctuations
- **Finding:** Sales dropped in **May** and **July**, possibly due to inadequate planning.
- **Recommendation:** Implement promotional campaigns during low seasons and use **data-driven forecasting** to adjust inventory strategies.

### Uneven Performance Across Product Categories
- **Finding:** Sales rely heavily on *Mens*, *Home (090)*, and *Shoes (050)*, while *Womens (010)* and *Hosiery (070)* declined.
- **Recommendation:** Expand *Kids (030)* and *Juniors (040)* categories; introduce promotions to boost underperforming segments.

### Regional Sales Strategy Adjustments
- **Finding:** Best-selling products vary by region (e.g., home goods more popular in inland cities than footwear).
- **Recommendation:** Optimize inventory and marketing strategies based on **regional demand** to improve efficiency.

  - Outdated data; need to work with more recent datasets for practice.
  
- **Report design improvements:**
  - Limit the color scheme to **2‚Äì3 main colors**.
  - Reduce the number of charts per page to avoid visual clutter.
